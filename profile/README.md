## Hi there 👋

This is a place for me to keep static websites that I work on! I have 3 simple websites right now!

### Value Sorter
This is a website that helps you discover your values! This website was generated for my wife, who is a therapist, and finds this tool useful to use with her remote clients.

### Fantasy Biography Generator 

This is a very simple website that creates a random character for use in RPG games.

### Goblin Quest Online

Based on the tabletop RPG Goblin Quest! You join a room with other players, and play with them on a quest to discover the secrets of a snot pool. No account required!

It uses a backend of AWS. The infrastructure for it is kept in a private repo.
